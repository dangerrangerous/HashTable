    CONSOLE APPLICATION : HashTableProject Project Overview
========================================================================

This hashtable project was created for an advanced data structures class.
It utilizes a series of doublylinked lists stored in a vector to hold key
values generated by a simple hash function. Debugging this was a trick
since I ran into an issue where if the doubly linked list only had one
entry the entry would infinitely point to itself as it was both firstNode
and lastNode. This sometimes nuked the output. I had some issues with object
lifespans when creating the lists, and once again the pointers are not 'safe'
as functionality was the main goal. Fair warning. As it stands there is no menu 
for this project.
